0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O ‚úèÔ∏è
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of sorting algoritms and was a project done along a great partner Daniela Vasquez

At the end of this project, We were able to achieve:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
Tasks ‚úîÔ∏è
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence
Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm (Task in progress)
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
